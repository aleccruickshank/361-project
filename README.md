# Typing Race Application

Overview:

Welcome! This is a typing race web application, users will be served a prompt to type after entering a race. Upon completion of the prompt, users will see their typing speed in the form of words per minute (WPM), along with the amount of mistakes they have made.

This application was built using flask as the web framework, and SQlite3 for data persistance. All race logic was written in JavaScript.

In the future, I'll be looking to add profile pages, and the ability to race against others.

Run the Project:

The project can be installed and ran locally. Install all dependencies, and run python app.py and node partnermicroservice.js.
